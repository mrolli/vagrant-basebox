vagrant-basebox
===============

Personal stuff regarding base box management.

The scripts/files in this directory are deprecated and reside historically in the attic. They 
are dealing manually with building base boxes.

Current files:
  * postinstall_ubuntu.sh - Customized script for ubuntu to be run after clean distro installation.
  * postinstall_rhel.sh - Customized script for rhel and derivates to be run after clean distro instllation.
  * Vagrantfile.pkg - Custom Vagrantfile due to user ladmin (instead of vagrant).
